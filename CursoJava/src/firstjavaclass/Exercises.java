	 * sides is a right-angled triangle. The method should return true if the
	 * triangle is right-angled and false otherwise.
	 * 
	 * In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the
	 * side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the
	 * lengths of the other two sides. This is known as the Pythagorean theorem.
